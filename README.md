This is an ES6-ified version of @jxnblk's [React Static Site Boilerplate project](https://github.com/jxnblk/react-static-site-boilerplate). It's largely the same, just using the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) plugin for Webpack. 

See the original article here:

Update: You might find [react-static-boilerplate](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate) to be a more complete/coherant option.
