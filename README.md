# Project Me Web

---

React project based on an ES6-ified version of @jxnblk's [React Static Site Boilerplate project](https://github.com/jxnblk/react-static-site-boilerplate). It's largely the same, just using the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) plugin for Webpack. The resume jsx parsing is an extension of the resume json schema.
